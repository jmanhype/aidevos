# Claude Code Integration with AIDevOS

This document outlines how Claude Code can be integrated with the AIDevOS project to enhance the multi-agent development workflow.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool developed by Anthropic that:

- Lives in your terminal
- Understands your codebase
- Helps you code faster through natural language commands
- Executes routine tasks
- Explains complex code
- Handles git workflows

## Key Features of Claude Code

### Core Capabilities

- **Edit files and fix bugs** across your codebase
- **Answer questions** about your code's architecture and logic
- **Execute and fix tests**, lint, and other commands
- **Search through git history**, resolve merge conflicts, create commits and PRs
- **Understand project context** without manually adding files to context

### Security and Privacy

- Direct API connection to Anthropic
- Operates directly in your terminal
- Tiered permission system for different operations
- Protection against prompt injection

### Tools Available to Claude

Claude Code has access to various tools:

| Tool | Description | Requires Approval |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| BashTool | Executes shell commands | Yes |
| GlobTool | Finds files based on pattern matching | No |
| GrepTool | Searches for patterns in file contents | No |
| LSTool | Lists files and directories | No |
| FileReadTool | Reads file contents | No |
| FileEditTool | Makes targeted edits to files | Yes |
| FileWriteTool | Creates or overwrites files | Yes |
| NotebookReadTool | Reads Jupyter notebook contents | No |
| NotebookEditTool | Modifies Jupyter notebook cells | Yes |

## Integration with AIDevOS Multi-Agent Workflow

The AIDevOS project already uses a multi-branch collaborative approach with tmux sessions. Claude Code can enhance this workflow in several ways:

### 1. Enhanced Agent Capabilities

Each specialized agent (PM, Backend, Frontend, DevOps, QA, Security) can use Claude Code to:

- Analyze existing code in their domain
- Generate new code based on specifications
- Review and refine code from other agents
- Document their work automatically

### 2. Streamlined Multi-Agent Communication

Claude Code can help with:

- Summarizing changes for other agents to review
- Creating consistent documentation across agents
- Generating interface definitions for cross-agent collaboration
- Automating git operations for branch management

### 3. Improved CI/CD Pipeline

Claude Code can enhance the CI/CD pipeline by:

- Automating test creation and execution
- Identifying and fixing issues in the pipeline
- Generating deployment scripts
- Monitoring and reporting on deployment status

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### 2. Configure Claude Code for AIDevOS

Create project-specific configurations:

```bash
# Allow specific tools to run without approval
claude config add allowedTools "Bash(npm test:*)"

# Ignore node_modules and other large directories
claude config add ignorePatterns node_modules
claude config add ignorePatterns "node_modules/**"
claude config add ignorePatterns ".git"
```

### 3. Update the tmux Setup Script

Modify `setup-aidevos-team.sh` to initialize Claude Code in each tmux window with appropriate context:

```bash
# Example addition to the PM-Architecture window setup
tmux send-keys "cd ~/aidevos && git checkout pm-architecture" C-m
tmux send-keys "echo 'Claude Instance 1 - PM & Architecture Agent'" C-m
tmux send-keys "claude \"Summarize the current architecture and identify areas for improvement\"" C-m
```

### 4. Create Agent-Specific Claude Code Prompts

Develop specialized prompts for each agent role. A comprehensive set of prompts is available in the [Claude Code Prompts](./claude-code-prompts.md) document, which includes:

- **PM Agent**: Architecture assessment, feature planning, and task breakdown prompts
- **Backend Agent**: API design, database schema, and Durable Object implementation prompts
- **Frontend Agent**: UI component design, state management, and testing prompts
- **DevOps Agent**: CI/CD pipeline, deployment configuration, and monitoring prompts
- **Security Agent**: Security audit, authentication, and data protection prompts
- **Merger Agent**: Code review, conflict resolution, and release preparation prompts

These prompts are designed to maximize the effectiveness of Claude Code for each specific role in the AIDevOS multi-agent workflow.

## Best Practices for Using Claude Code with AIDevOS

1. **Use specific queries** rather than vague requests
2. **Break down complex tasks** into focused interactions
3. **Compact conversations** with `/compact` when context gets large
4. **Clear history between tasks** with `/clear` to reset context
5. **Review suggested commands** before approval
6. **Verify proposed changes** to critical files
7. **Use file-based workflows** for large inputs rather than direct pasting

## Cost Management

Claude Code consumes tokens for each interaction:

- Typical usage costs range from $5-10 per developer day
- Can exceed $100 per hour during intensive use

To manage costs effectively:

- Review cost summary displayed when exiting
- Check historical usage in Anthropic Console
- Set spend limits
- Use `/cost` to show token usage statistics
- Consider connecting to Amazon Bedrock for reduced costs and higher rate limits

## Conclusion

Integrating Claude Code with the AIDevOS multi-agent workflow can significantly enhance productivity and code quality. By leveraging Claude Code's capabilities for each specialized agent, the system can evolve more rapidly and with greater coherence across components.

The combination of AIDevOS's Durable Objects architecture and Claude Code's agentic capabilities creates a powerful platform for AI-driven software development that can adapt and scale to meet changing requirements.
