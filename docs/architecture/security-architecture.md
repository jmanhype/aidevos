## Security Overview

The AIDevOS security architecture is designed around the following key principles:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect the system.
- **Least Privilege**: Users and components have only the minimum access necessary to perform their functions.
- **Zero Trust**: No entity is trusted by default, regardless of its location inside or outside the network.
- **Secure by Design**: Security is integrated into the development lifecycle from the beginning.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: The system is continuously monitored for security events and anomalies.

The security architecture diagram shows the main security components and their relationships:

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication

AIDevOS implements JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication:

1. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - User provides credentials
   - Authentication Service validates credentials
   - If valid, a signed JWT token is issued with user identity and roles
   - Token is returned to the client for use in subsequent requests

2. **Token Validation**:
   - Each request includes the JWT token in the Authorization header
   - API Gateway validates the token signature and expiration
   - If valid, the request proceeds; otherwise, it is rejected

3. **Token Management**:
   - Tokens have a configured expiration time (default: 30 minutes)
   - Refresh tokens can be issued for extended sessions
   - Tokens can be revoked for security reasons

### Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to manage permissions:

1. **Role Definition**:
   - Predefined roles: Admin, Developer, Operator, Viewer
   - Custom roles can be created with specific permissions

2. **Permission Enforcement**:
   - Each API endpoint is protected by role requirements
   - Authorization middleware checks if the user has the required roles
   - Requests without sufficient permissions are rejected

3. **Privilege Management**:
   - Least privilege principle is enforced
   - Role assignments are reviewed regularly
   - Critical operations require additional verification

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

1. **Data at Rest**:
   - Database encryption for sensitive data
   - File encryption for stored artifacts
   - Encryption keys are managed securely

2. **Data in Transit**:
   - All communications use TLS 1.2+ encryption
   - Secure cipher suites are enforced
   - Certificate validation is required

3. **Key Management**:
   - Encryption keys are rotated regularly
   - Keys are stored securely, separate from encrypted data
   - Key access is logged and audited

### Data Classification

Data is classified into the following categories:

1. **Public**: Information that can be freely shared
2. **Internal**: Information for internal use only
3. **Confidential**: Sensitive information that requires protection
4. **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls

Each category has specific handling requirements and security controls.

## Communication Security

1. **TLS Encryption**:
   - All API communications use TLS 1.2+
   - Strong cipher suites are enforced
   - Certificate validation is required

2. **API Gateway**:
   - Central point for communication security
   - Enforces TLS termination
   - Implements rate limiting and DDoS protection

3. **Service Mesh**:
   - Encrypts service-to-service communication
   - Implements mutual TLS for service authentication
   - Provides traffic management and observability

## API Security

1. **Input Validation**:
   - All API inputs are validated
   - Strict schema validation is enforced
   - Input sanitization is applied to prevent injection attacks

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Requests are rate-limited by IP and user
   - Configurable limits to prevent abuse
   - Graduated response to excessive requests

3. **CORS Protection**:
   - Strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy
   - Allowed origins are explicitly configured
   - Credentials and headers are controlled

4. **CSRF Protection**:
   - Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
   - Token validation for all non-GET requests
   - Same-site cookie attributes

## Infrastructure Security

1. **Container Security**:
   - Minimal base images
   - No privileged containers
   - Image scanning for vulnerabilities
   - Runtime security monitoring

2. **Network Security**:
   - Network segmentation for isolation
   - Restrictive network policies
   - Ingress and egress filtering
   - Internal traffic encryption

3. **Secret Management**:
   - Centralized secret management
   - Just-in-time access to secrets
   - Rotation and versioning
   - Audit logging for secret access

## Vulnerability Management

1. **Security Scanning**:
   - Automated code scanning for vulnerabilities
   - Dependency scanning for known CVEs

   - Vulnerability prioritization based on risk
   - Critical vulnerabilities addressed within 24 hours
   - Regular vulnerability assessment

3. **Third-Party Dependencies**:
   - Vulnerability scanning for dependencies
   - Approval process for new dependencies
   - Dependency updates and version management
   - Supply chain security measures

## Compliance & Governance

1. **Audit Logging**:
   - Comprehensive logging of security events
   - Tamper-proof log storage
   - Log retention policy
   - Log analysis for security incidents
