```

## Architecture Refinements

Based on our architecture analysis, we've made several key refinements to the original design:

1. **Modular Agent Architecture**: Enhanced the agent framework with clear separation of core functionality and specialized agent behavior.

2. **Enhanced Orchestration Layer**: Added a Service Composer to simplify agent interaction with Durable Objects.

3. **Self-Improvement Architecture**: Created a concrete feedback loop with measurable metrics and learning modules.

4. **Data Flow Architecture**: Defined clear interfaces between system components with explicit security boundaries.

5. **Scalability Architecture**: Designed for horizontal scaling with distributed nodes and sharded persistence.

## Next Steps

The following tasks are prioritized for immediate implementation:

1. **Agent Framework Enhancements** (in progress)
   - Implement remaining specialized agents (Backend, Frontend, DevOps)
   - Create agent state persistence mechanism
   - Enhance agent testing framework

2. **Basic Orchestration Layer**
   - Implement Service Registry
   - Create Request Router
   - Develop State Manager

3. **Simple Durable Object**
   - Implement base DO class
   - Create lifecycle management
   - Develop state persistence

## Architecture Decision Records

The following Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) have been approved:

### ADR-1: Agent Communication Protocol

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Agents need to communicate efficiently while maintaining a clear record of interactions, decisions, and reasoning.

**Decision**: Implement a structured message protocol with the following properties:
- JSON-based message format
- Required fields: sender, recipient, messageType, content, timestamp, messageId
- Optional fields: replyTo, metadata, attachments
- Support for broadcast messages to all agents
- Asynchronous message delivery with acknowledgments
- Persistence of message history

**Consequences**:
- All agent communication will be structured and traceable
- Message history provides context for decision-making
- Protocol overhead is acceptable for the benefits gained
- Future extensions can build on the established message structure

### ADR-2: Durable Object State Management

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: Durable Objects need efficient state management that supports persistence, consistency, and scaling.

**Decision**: Implement a two-tiered state management approach:
- In-memory state for active operations
- Persistent state backed by a document database
- Optimistic concurrency control for state updates
- Event-sourced design for change tracking
- State versioning for migrations

**Consequences**:
- Objects can be efficiently hibernated and revived
- State history provides audit trail and recovery options
- Performance overhead for persistence is manageable
- Additional complexity in state management logic
- Requires careful handling of schema evolution
