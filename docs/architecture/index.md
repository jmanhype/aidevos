## How to View the Diagrams

The architecture diagrams are created using [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), a markdown-based diagramming tool. To view the diagrams:

1. Open the markdown files in a Mermaid-compatible viewer
2. Use a Markdown editor that supports Mermaid (like VS Code with the Markdown Preview Mermaid Support extension)
3. Copy the Mermaid code into the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)

## Diagram Types

The architecture documentation uses various diagram types to represent different aspects of the system:

- **Flow Diagrams**: Show the flow of data or control through the system
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Illustrate the sequence of interactions between components
- **State Diagrams**: Represent the states and transitions of system components
- **Gantt Charts**: Visualize the project timeline and dependencies
- **Mind Maps**: Organize and structure complex information hierarchically

## Contributing to the Documentation

When adding or updating architecture diagrams:

1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Use consistent styling across diagrams
3. Include explanatory text to accompany each diagram
4. Update this index file to reflect any new additions
