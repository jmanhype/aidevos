## Using These SOPs in the tmux Setup

You can incorporate these SOPs into your `setup-aidevos-team.sh` script to automatically initialize each Claude Code instance with the appropriate context. For example:

```bash
# Configure the PM-Architecture window
tmux send-keys "cd ~/aidevos && git checkout pm-architecture" C-m
tmux send-keys "echo 'Claude Instance 1 - PM & Architecture Agent'" C-m
tmux send-keys "claude" C-m
# Wait for Claude to initialize
sleep 2
# Paste the PM & Architecture Agent SOP
tmux send-keys "You are the PM & Architecture Agent for the AIDevOS system, responsible for system design, feature planning, and architecture. Your role is to define the overall structure of the system, plan features, and ensure architectural coherence across all components..." C-m
```

These comprehensive SOPs provide each agent with a clear understanding of their responsibilities, workflows, and expected outputs, ensuring a cohesive and effective multi-agent development process for the AIDevOS system.
