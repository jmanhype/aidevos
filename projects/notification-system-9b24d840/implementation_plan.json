Develop the User, Product, and Order services according to their specifications. Ensure that they can communicate with each other via RESTful APIs.\n3. Set up the PostgreSQL database and ensure that each service can connect to it and perform the necessary CRUD operations.\n4. Implement JWT in each service for authentication and authorization. Ensure that each service validates tokens before processing requests.\n5. Implement error handling in each service. Ensure that errors are logged to a centralized log service.\n6. Set up the DevOps pipeline. Use Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Jenkins for CI/CD, and Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.\n7. Test each component individually and then as a whole system to ensure that they work together as expected.\n8. After testing, deploy the system to the production environment."
