# AIDevOS Projects Directory

This directory contains AIDevOS project resources organized into the following subdirectories:

## Structure

- **features/** - Contains feature specifications, requirements, and implementation plans
  - Each feature should have its own subdirectory with documentation, diagrams, and code
  - Example: `features/auth-service/`, `features/data-pipeline/`

- **services/** - Contains service implementations and configurations
  - Each service should have its own subdirectory with source code, tests, and deployment configurations
  - Example: `services/user-service/`, `services/notification-service/`

- **ui/** - Contains user interface components and frontend applications
  - Each UI project should have its own subdirectory with source code, assets, and build configurations
  - Example: `ui/admin-dashboard/`, `ui/user-portal/`

## Usage

This directory is used by the AI Team Collaboration framework to store project artifacts during the development process.

The directories are populated by the specialized AI agents (PM, Dev, DevOps, UX) as they collaborate to design, implement, and deploy features and services.

## Best Practices

1. Follow the directory structure and naming conventions
2. Include README files in each project subdirectory to explain its purpose and structure
3. Use version control for tracking changes
4. Keep documentation up-to-date and aligned with code implementations
5. Follow the coding standards and guidelines specified in the AIDevOS documentation
