# AIDevOS - AI-Driven Autonomous DevOps System

AIDevOS is a self-evolving AI DevOps system that automates the development, deployment, and evolution of SaaS applications using AI-driven multi-agent collaboration and Durable Objects (DOs).

## üöÄ Overview

AIDevOS enables:
1. Receiving a product spec from a user or business requirement
2. AI agents discussing and refining the architecture
3. Durable Objects acting as modular microservices
4. AI writing, testing, and deploying code iteratively
5. The system expanding itself dynamically as complexity grows

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components

### 1. Multi-LLM Chat System
- AI agents with distinct roles: PM, Backend, Frontend, DevOps, QA, Security
- Uses debate/reflection cycles to refine architecture
- Output: System architecture + task breakdown

### 2. Durable Objects (DOs) for Microservices
- Each DO acts as an independent service with its own logic
- AI deploys DOs dynamically to expand functionality
- AI can redeploy DOs to evolve architecture

### 3. AI-Driven CI/CD Pipeline
- AI writes code ‚Üí runs tests ‚Üí deploys via a pipeline
- If an issue is found, AI refines and redeploys
- Logs and feedback loops ensure continuous improvement

### 4. Self-Improving Deployment Engine
- AI monitors performance and resource utilization
- Spins up new DOs or refactors existing ones
- Uses reinforcement learning to optimize architecture

### Getting Started with the Frontend:
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd src/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## ü§ñ Claude Code Integration

AIDevOS can be enhanced with Claude Code, an agentic coding tool from Anthropic:

- [Claude Code Integration](./docs/claude-code-integration.md): Detailed guide on integrating Claude Code with AIDevOS
- [Claude Code Prompts](./docs/claude-code-prompts.md): Specialized prompts for each agent role
- [Agent SOPs](./docs/aidevos-agent-sops.md): Comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures for each agent
- Enhances multi-agent workflow with AI-powered coding assistance
- Provides implementation plan and best practices for using Claude Code with AIDevOS

## üß† DSPy Integration

AIDevOS includes a rich integration with the DSPy framework to enable LLM-powered agents:

### ‚ú® DSPy Agent Classes
- üìä `DSPyPMAgent`: Project management tasks including requirements analysis and architecture design
- üíª `DSPyDevAgent`: Development tasks including code generation and code review
- üîß `DSPyDevOpsAgent`: DevOps tasks including deployment planning and infrastructure design
- üé® `DSPyUXAgent`: UX tasks including UI design and usability testing

### üîÑ Agent Architecture

    A[DSPyAgent Base Class] --> B[DSPyPMAgent]
    A --> C[DSPyDevAgent]
    A --> D[DSPyDevOpsAgent]
    A --> E[DSPyUXAgent]
    
    B --> F[Requirements Analysis]
    B --> G[Architecture Design]
    
    C --> H[Code Generation]
    C --> I[Code Review]
    
    D --> J[Deployment Planning]
    D --> K[Infrastructure Design]
    
    E --> L[UI Design]
    E --> M[Usability Testing]
```

All agent classes implement a standardized `process_task` async method, allowing seamless integration with both synchronous and asynchronous workflows.

### Key DSPy Features in AIDevOS:

- **DSPy-enabled Agents**: Each agent role (PM, Dev, DevOps, UX) has a DSPy-powered version
- **Optimizable Modules**: Agent capabilities are built as DSPy modules that can be optimized
- **Pluggable LLM Support**: Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers
- **Structured Reasoning**: DSPy's structured signatures provide better reasoning patterns

### Getting Started with DSPy Integration:

```bash
# Install DSPy dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dspy.txt

# Set your API key in environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run the DSPy-enabled team collaboration
python src/dspy_team_collaboration.py
```

For more details, see the implementation in:
- `src/agents/dspy_modules.py`: DSPy module implementations
- `src/agents/dspy_agent.py`: DSPy-enabled agent classes
- `src/dspy_team_collaboration.py`: Main implementation using DSPy agents
- `src/config/dspy_config.py`: Configuration for DSPy (API keys, models)

## üîÑ Self-Modifying Code Capability

AIDevOS now includes a powerful self-modification system that allows agents to improve their own code:

- **Auto-Generated Improvements**: Agents analyze their performance and generate code improvements
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic branch creation, commits, and pull requests
- **Durable Objects Enhancement**: Durable Objects can now evolve their own implementation
- **Feedback Loop**: Performance metrics drive continuous code optimization

### Key Self-Modification Features:

- **Code Mutator Engine**: Core system for modifying code based on AI-generated prompts
- **Self-Improvement Analysis**: Identifies optimization opportunities based on metrics
- **Version Control Integration**: Safely deploys changes through GitHub workflow
- **Transparent Explanations**: All modifications include detailed explanations

### Getting Started with Self-Modifying Agents:

```bash
# Set up GitHub integration
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-here"
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY="your-username/your-repo"

# Run the self-modifying agent example
python examples/self_modifying_agent.py
```

- `src/deployment/code_mutator.py`: Core implementation of code modification capabilities
- `src/deployment/self_improvement.py`: Performance analysis and optimization identification
- `examples/self_modifying_agent.py`: Example of a self-modifying DSPy agent

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

AIDevOS uses a multi-branch collaborative approach:

1. **PM-Architecture Branch**: System design, feature planning, and architecture
2. **Backend-DB Branch**: API design, database models, and business logic
3. **Frontend-UI Branch**: UI/UX design, frontend components, and user interactions
4. **DevOps-QA Branch**: CI/CD pipeline, testing, deployment, and monitoring
5. **Main Branch**: Integration, merging, and release management
